    " \n",
    "  ### •Importing Necessary Libraries: We imported the required libraries, including pandas for data manipulation, nltk for natural language processing, and the VADER sentiment analyzer.\n",
    "  ### •Initializing VADER Sentiment Analyzer: We initialized the SentimentIntensityAnalyzer from the nltk.sentiment.vader module.\n",
    "  ### •Function to Get Sentiment Score: We defined a function get_sentiment_score() to calculate the sentiment score for each review using VADER's polarity_scores() method.\n",
    "  ### •Applying Sentiment Analysis: We applied sentiment analysis to the 'content' column of our dataset and   created a new column 'sentiment_score' to store the calculated sentiment scores.\n",
    "  ### •Function to Classify Sentiments: We defined a function classify_sentiment() to classify sentiments based on the sentiment score into 'Positive', 'Negative', or 'Neutral'.\n",
    "  ### •Applying Sentiment Classification: We applied sentiment classification to the sentiment scores and created a new column 'sentiment' to store the sentiment labels.\n",
    "  ### •Printing the Results: We printed the content, sentiment score, and sentiment label for each review in the dataset.\n",

    "## ◙ Summary:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ### •The sentiment analysis was conducted using the VADER lexicon, which is specifically designed for sentiment analysis of social media text.\n",
    "  ###  •Each review was assigned a sentiment score ranging from -1 (extremely negative) to 1 (extremely positive).\n",
    "  ###  •Based on the sentiment scores, the reviews were classified into three categories: Positive, Negative, or Neutral.\n",
    "  ### •The majority of reviews were classified as Positive, indicating overall satisfaction with the app.\n",
    "  ###  •Some reviews were classified as Negative, indicating dissatisfaction or negative experiences with the app.\n",
    "  ###  •Neutral reviews were those with sentiment scores close to zero, suggesting a lack of strong positive or negative sentiment.\n",
    "  ### •Overall, this lexicon-based sentiment analysis with VADER provided valuable insights into the sentiment distribution of the reviews, helping to understand user opinions and experiences with the app."
